# Dual Licensing Under MIT/Apache 2.0

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In order to maximize code reusability and compatibility across various projects and platforms, we are considering adopting a dual licensing strategy under both the MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses. This is motivated by the need to provide users with flexible licensing options while ensuring compatibility and adhering to open source principles.

## Decision

We will dual-license our project under the MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses. This means that users can choose to use the project under either the MIT license (<LICENSE-MIT> or <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>) or the Apache License, Version 2.0 (<LICENSE-APACHE> or <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>).

## Consequences

Dual licensing under MIT/Apache 2.0 provides users with more flexibility in terms of how they can integrate and use our project's codebase. It also helps ensure compatibility with a broader range of projects and platforms. However, it may require additional effort to maintain consistent licensing information across all project files. We will update the project's README file accordingly, as shown below:

## Notes

While we are not lawyers, at this time we believe MIT/Apache 2.0 will serve us well - it's used by the rust ecosystem, and is also compatible with the licenses that the Golang environment frequently uses. MIT is permissive enough it will also permit us to reuse our code elsewhere.
