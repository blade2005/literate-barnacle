# Adopting ADRs

## Context

There is a growing need for documenting our architectural decisions in a structured manner in the industry. Adopting this trend early will allow us to track changes, maintain consistency, and facilitate knowledge sharing among team members.

It is especially useful in answering the question "But why did they do this?" after the context of a decision has long been forgotten.

This led to the consideration of using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

## Decision

We propose adopting ADRs, primarily using the lightweight ADR template provided by Michael Nygard available at Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard (<http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions>). We will manage the ADR files using adr-tools (<https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools>).

Where appropriate, when there is contention, high-risk decisions, or one-way doors, a more rigorous ADR process with figures of merit to weigh alternatives may be used.

## Consequences

Adopting ADRs will help improve transparency, maintain consistency, and enable better communication regarding our architectural decisions. It might require additional time investment in creating and maintaining ADR documents but should overall lead to a more robust and maintainable system design.
